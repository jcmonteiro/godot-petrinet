# Godot Petri Network
This is a simple implementation of Petri Networks in Godot Engine. It is a an alternative to the usual state modeling with finite state machines that is more suitable for modeling concurrent systems.

# Instructions
I recommend using VSCode for editing the source code since the `.vscode` folder is included in the repository. Just remember to select VSCode as your external editor in your Godot Editor settings.
